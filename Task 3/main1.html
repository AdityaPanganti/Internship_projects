<p><font size="6"color="white">A motorcycle is a two-wheeled vehicle with an engine. Motorcycles are bigger, heavier, and much faster than bicycles, but they have many similar parts.
 Like bicycles, motorcycles are often called bikes.
Motorcycles are a common form of transportation throughout the world. People also ride them in races or just for fun.

Like an automobile, a motorcycle usually has an internal-combustion engine powered by gasoline. 
The body of the motorcycle, called the frame, is usually made of steel. Handlebars and a cushioned seat sit on top of the frame. 
The two tires are attached to the front and the back of the frame. They are much like car tires, but smaller.

Brakes, a headlight, a taillight, turn signals, and a horn are important safety features on every motorcycle.
 Some motorcycles have crash bars, which keep the motorcycle from hitting the ground if it falls over.
 A motorcycle might also have a windshield for protection.

Motorcycles are designed for different purposes. Street bikes, touring bikes, and small mopeds and scooters are built mainly for riding on paved roadways. 
Touring bikes are specially equipped for long-distance highway travel. 
Lightweight dirt bikes, racing bikes, trail bikes, and minibikes are meant for off-road biking.</font>

Motorcycle riders need their hands and their feet to drive their vehicles. 
The driver turns on the engine using a key. Once the engine is on, the driver uses controls on the handlebars and foot pedals to drive. 
Gears on the handlebars control the speed of the vehicle. The handlebars also have a lever to control the front brakes. Pedals control the rear brakes.

Motorcyclists must obey the rules of the road and follow other laws related to motorcycles. 
Many countries require a special driverâ€™s license for operating motorcycles. In some places every motorcyclist must wear a helmet.

Many inventors in the 1800s tried to put engines on bicycles. 
These first motorcycles had steam-powered engines. 
In 1884 a British inventor put a gasoline engine on a three-wheeled motorcycle.  
By 1900 many people were building two-wheeled motorcycles with gasoline engines.
